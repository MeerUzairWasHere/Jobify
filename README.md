## Built With

Absolutely! Integrating React Query and Styled Components into Jobify enhances the application with efficient data management and a sleek, styled UI. Here's an updated list of technologies used in Jobify, now including React Query and Styled Components:

1. **MongoDB (M):**
   - A NoSQL database that provides scalability and flexibility. MongoDB efficiently stores and manages data related to job applications, profiles, and user information.

2. **Express.js (E):**
   - A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building scalable and robust server-side applications. Express.js is the backbone of Jobify's server architecture, handling routes and business logic.

3. **React.js (R):**
   - A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js is used to create the dynamic and responsive front-end of Jobify, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience for job seekers.

4. **React Router:**
   - A library for adding navigation and routing functionality to React applications. React Router is integrated into Jobify to enable seamless navigation between different views, such as the dashboard, application profiles, and analytics.

5. **React Query:**
   - A library for managing and caching asynchronous data fetching in React applications. React Query optimizes data fetching and state management, providing a more efficient way to handle data throughout Jobify.

6. **Styled Components:**
   - A library for styling React components with scoped and reusable styles. Styled Components allow for the creation of a consistent and visually appealing UI in Jobify, enhancing the overall user experience.

7. **Node.js (N):**
   - A JavaScript runtime that allows server-side execution. Node.js powers the server in Jobify, facilitating fast and efficient communication between the front-end and the database.

8. **Additional Technologies:**
   - Various additional technologies and libraries complement the MERN Stack, React Router, React Query, and Styled Components. These may include libraries for authentication, data validation, and other features critical to a comprehensive job application tracking system.

With the integration of React Query, Jobify ensures optimal data management, making the application more responsive and improving the overall user experience. Styled Components contribute to a sleek and visually consistent design, enhancing the aesthetics and usability of the application. This combination of technologies makes Jobify a powerful and modern job application tracking solution.
